## About Me

I'm a Full Stack Engineer currently studying at Atlas Coding School in Tulsa, Oklahoma. I've always been interested in computers and the code behind websites, apps, and video games. Now I'm learning how to write that code using modern programming languages and frameworks.

 I am proficient in Typescript, React, Node.js, and Express.js. I have a passion for building interactive web applications and continuously improving my software development skills. I'm interested in roles that allow me to work with talented teams, contribute to innovative projects, and grow as a developer. 

 I'm excited to learn more about software development and see what lies ahead in my career!
